# üå´Ô∏è Time Series Analysis on Air Quality Data

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview

This project demonstrates **time series forecasting** on air quality data from `AirQualityUCI.xlsx`. It covers **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), ARIMA modeling, SARIMAX and Prophet forecasting**, and exports forecasts for real-world environmental monitoring and dashboards.

## üéØ Objectives

‚úÖ Clean and preprocess raw air quality sensor data  
‚úÖ Perform EDA to understand trends, seasonality, and outliers  
‚úÖ Train ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Prophet models for pollutant forecasting  
‚úÖ Export forecast results for practical analysis and reporting

## üîπ Key Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Load `AirQualityUCI.xlsx` into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge `Date` and `Time` into a single datetime index.
- Replace `-200` with `NaN` and interpolate missing values.
- Prepare clean, continuous pollutant time series for modeling.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Basic statistics and descriptive summaries.
- Missing value heatmaps to detect systematic issues.
- Time series plots to visualize pollutant trends.
- Histograms and KDE plots for distribution insights.
- Correlation heatmaps to identify feature relationships.
- Boxplots for outlier detection.
- Seasonal decomposition to analyze trend and seasonality.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ARIMA Forecasting

- Fit ARIMA `(p=1, d=1, q=1)` on `CO(GT)` for initial forecasting.
- Evaluate residuals and visualize forecasts vs actual values.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Forecasting with SARIMAX and Prophet

- Fit SARIMAX models using exogenous weather features for each pollutant.
- Fit Prophet models for hourly forecasts, including external regressors.
- Compare and analyze multi-model outputs.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Export Forecasts

- Generate future hourly timestamps for the forecast period.
- Export SARIMAX and Prophet forecasts to Excel with structured sheets for practical analysis.

---

## üìä Results

The project demonstrates:
- Handling of **real-world noisy sensor data**.
- Application of **multiple time series forecasting models**.
- Automation of **forecast generation and export** for air quality data analysis.

---

## ü™Ñ Purpose

This project builds practical skills in:
- Preparing and validating time series datasets.
- Applying classical and advanced forecasting models.
- Automating analysis pipelines for environmental data use cases.
