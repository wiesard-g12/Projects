📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

🗂️ Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices using historical data. It uses the apple_20.csv dataset containing Apple's historical stock prices for model training and testing.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Load and preprocess stock price data

✅ Build and train an LSTM model for time series prediction

✅ Visualize predicted vs actual stock prices to evaluate performance

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas and NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Open StockPrediction_using_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

2️⃣ Run all cells to:

Preprocess the data

Train the LSTM model

Visualize predicted vs actual stock prices

📊 Results

The LSTM model effectively captures stock price trends, providing a clear visual comparison of actual and predicted prices to understand stock movement patterns.
