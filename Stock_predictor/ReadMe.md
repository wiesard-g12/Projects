Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Overview :

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices using historical data. It uses the apple_20.csv dataset containing Apple's historical stock prices for model training and testing.

Objectives :

Load and preprocess stock price data

Build and train an LSTM model for time series prediction

Visualize predicted vs actual stock prices to evaluate performance

Technologies Used :

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas and NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

How to Run :

Open StockPrediction_using_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize predictions.

Results :

The LSTM model captures stock price trends, providing a visual comparison of actual and predicted prices for understanding stock movement patterns.
