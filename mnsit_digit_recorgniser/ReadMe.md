MNIST CNN Digit Classifier

-Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

-Dataset
MNIST dataset with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images
Images are 28x28 grayscale of digits 0â€“9

-Model
CNN with convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers
Softmax output layer for classification
Built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras

-Results
Achieves around 99.16 % test accuracy on kaggle
Visualizes predictions for verification

-How to Run
Open MNIST_cnn.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
